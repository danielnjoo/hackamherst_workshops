# hackamherst_workshops

This is the repo for Amherst College's 2018 pre-hack workshop series. The [hackathon](hackamherst.com) will take place on the first weekend of March (3-4) from 2pm-2pm. The pre-hack series covers elements of web development that would be pertinent to a hackathon project, and are designed to not require any prior experience â€” although resilience in Googling is a must for any software development!

Each workshop's materials will be contained in this folder, and they're broken down into steps that are separated by commits. This means that you can access each separate step by 'checking out' different commits.
